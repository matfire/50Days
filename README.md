# 50 Days of HTML, CSS and JS

This repository contains my attempts at exercises from Brad Traversy and Florin Pop's [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/).
The goal of this course is to build different elements without using frameworks. You can see a list of completed projects [here](https://50days.matteogassend.com)
